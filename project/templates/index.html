	This project is designed to help organizations send educational emails and measure how users interact with them. By
	tracking link clicks through emails, it provides insights into which topics users are engaging with the most. The
	goal is to identify areas where more awareness or education may be needed â€” all through a simple, data-driven
	interface.
